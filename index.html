                        A backend developer could just be focused on a database and providing an API to it or on a server language like PHP.

                        <p>A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso with microfoam (steamed milk with small, fine bubbles and a glossy or velvety consistency). It is comparable to a latte, 
                        but smaller in volume and with less microfoam, therefore having a higher proportion of coffee to milk, and milk that is more velvety in consistency – allowing the espresso to dominate the flavour, 
                        while being supported by the milk. The earliest documented references to the beverage date back to Australia in the mid-1980s.

                <h2>Back End Developor - Wannabe</h2>
                <p>Hi, this is Ray Kim who wants to become a backend developer by the end of this year. I'm studying hard to become a skillfull programmer equipped with exellent coding capability. Although it sometimes feels 
                    like an endlessly demanding work, I'll keep pushing it forward till I reach the goal I planned. I'm currently coding like the guy in the background image, who knows there's a bright future for him down the road.</p>
                <p>My hunch tells me it'll be literally my last chance to get a job, from which I can develop professional expertise and skills over time. These days, my daily routine is as follows: wake up in the early morning and go to 
                    a cafe or a public workplace to stay calm and just code. Some might say that programming is nothing but a series of tedious works that requires one to be trapped in the same daily routines until the retirement. 
                    However, if you observe it more carefully, you can soon realise programming is a kind of a war art, whereby a coder fights against computer to get the maximum possible result.</p>
